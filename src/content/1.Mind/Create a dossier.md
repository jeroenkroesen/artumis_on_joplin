# Create a dossier
###### t



## Creating and using dossiers
A dossier is basically a topic with added functionality for todo's. This allows you to use a dossier to manage work on a topic. 

There are two templates available by default for dossiers:
* `Dossier simple`
	* This dossier uses note overview to show todo's in various states
* `Dossier kanban`
	* This dossier provides a Kanban board for managing todo's
 
You can view all existing dossiers at: [Dossiers](../1.Mind/Dossiers.md). 

Dossiers have a status that organizes them on the [Dossiers](../1.Mind/Dossiers.md) page: `dossier.backlog` and `dossier.active` is for dossiers on the kanban board. A dossier can also have `dossier.permanent` and `dossier.archive`. These are not on the kanban board, but in queries above it, that can be folded so as not to distract you from the kanban board.

I've talked about using templates extensively already, so I will assume you can deduce how to use these templates. Otherwise, please review [Create a diary note](../1.Mind/Create%20a%20diary%20note.md) and [Create a topic](../1.Mind/Create%20a%20topic.md).

To make a todo appear on a dossier, tag it with that dossiers' topic tag.
