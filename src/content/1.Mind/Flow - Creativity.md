# Flow - Creativity
###### t
Artumis maximizes your creativity with a combination of this tools and behaviors or rituals. In the previous steps of getting started I've talked mostly about the tool. Now that it's setup, let's talk about the flow: how to write each day and build a second brain that is fun to surf and truly amplifies your own brain.

## A Rich Web of Creativity
Ideas come to me at all times. They pop up in various situations and sometimes I realize: "wow, this is something I want to write down!". In other situations I am having fun with family or friends and would like to remember in detail what we did or discussed. 

But a day in my life can also be hectic. I'm juggling being a dad and husband with working fulltime and things like sports to keep my body healthy. I don't always have the time or energy to sit down and write down everything I would like to write. When I do write down an idea during a busy day, I often don't have the time to think which topics it should connect to, or how to structure it otherwise.

*That's ok*

Your second brain should be setup to allow you to always *quickly dump information into it without fear of losing it like a needle in a haystack*.

In the Artumis system, you can easily dump an idea by writing a few lines about it in your diary note for today. If you want to come back later to expand on the idea or connect it to topics and other notes, *simply tag your diary note with the `to_process` tag*. This will make it appear on the [(1).Start](../1.Mind/%281%29.Start.md) page under `To process`. 

When you have a little time to sit down and surf your ideas, start with the `To process` list. It's incredbily easy and intuïtive in Artumis to move info from your diary to a separate note that can be linked and tagged. Your path to structure has been paved with simple templates with hints and pre-existing tags. 

So there are 2 phases to writing with the Artumis second brain:
1. Simply dump information into your diary note at any time
2. At a quiet and relaxed moment, structure your ideas at your leisure.
	* Easily move ideas to their own notes
	* Tag and link them to topics, locations, persons or any other type of notes to build ***a rich web of creativity***

Let's take look at a creative day and these phases.

## A daily habit
You won´t believe what a treasure of knowledge your second brain will provide if you spend a little time writing each day. It's just astonishing how it amplifies your brain. And it's easy!

...but ofcourse it is not completely effortless. Artumis works best if you make it a *habit* to write a little and to connect and structure your ideas every day. It takes effort and discipline to do this, but it doesn't take a lot of time. To quickly experience the power and creativity of this method, a good daily ritual looks like this:

| **Time of day** | **Duration** | **Action** |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| Morning | 2 minutes | Setup your diary note and sync laptop and mobile |
| All day | 15 minutes | Anything that comes to mind, write or speak it into the mobile app |
| Evening | 15 - 30 minutes | Relax and process the day | 

WIth `relax and process the day` I mean the following:
* Find a quiet place to sit with a laptop
* Make it cozy, with your favorite evening drink
* Sync mobile Joplin with your laptop and put away your mobile
* Take some time to read through today's diary note
	* Maybe you quickly wrote some short reminders during the day. Take the time now to expand them in to fully descibed ideas.
	* Add pictures to things you've experienced. Make it fun to look back at this day. Make your ideas come to life. 
* If you want to link something you wrote to a topic, follow the instructions in [Connect an idea to a topic](../1.Mind/Connect%20an%20idea%20to%20a%20topic.md).

When you've finished reviewing, processing and structuring your writing for today, remove the `to_process` tag from the diary note. This note is now done.

## Surf your brain's waves
Keep writing and connecting for a couple of weeks. Now, if you have an evening or a weekend day where there's a bit more time, sit down with your laptop and without worrying about the present day, surf around the things you've written. Start by looking at your [topics](../1.Mind/Topic.md). Keep a tab open with today's note as well, because browsing through your own head and experiences will likely lead to new ideas and inspiration. If you see new connections, take the time now to make them. 

It's possible that you're starting to see larger connections between ideas you've written down. Artumis offers the [Article](../1.Mind/Article.md) note type for longer writing. If you want to weave together ideas into a larger picture, start an article and you'll be able to link diary ideas to an article using the articles' tag, that starts with an `a.`. 

A really fun way to surf is by pressing `F8` to activate the `graph view`. This visualizes your notes as a network. You can see connections between notes and click on them to see their connections etc.

## Browse through your life
it can be fun to look at your life through the lens of time. What happened in march? What was I thinking about in june 3 years ago? Do I always get so many new ideas in spring?

Artumis can help you answer these questions. Take a look at your writing through the [Diary](../1.Mind/Diary.md) page and choose a year to browse. You see your notes ordered by month. It can be fascinating to track habits and thoughts through time.
