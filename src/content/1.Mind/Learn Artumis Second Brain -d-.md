# Learn Artumis Second Brain
###### t
Welcome to [Artumis](../1.Mind/Artumis%20Second%20Brain%20-t-.md)! Artumis is a method to build a second brain. A second brain is a tool that boosts your creativity and amplifies your focus. It's something that's best understood by using it. This [dossier](../1.Mind/Dossiers.md) will help you do just that: *get started with your second brain*.

Walk through the todo's below on the kanban board. You can move them between lanes by dragging them with the mouse and read them by clicking on them. 

Have fun!
