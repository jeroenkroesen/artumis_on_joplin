In the previous steps you've created a diary note and a topic. Now it's time to connect them. Go through the howto [Connect an idea to a topic](../1.Mind/Connect%20an%20idea%20to%20a%20topic.md). Afterwards, move this todo to `Done` and move [(B) Create a todo](../1.Mind/%28B%29%20Create%20a%20todo.md) to `Doing`.
