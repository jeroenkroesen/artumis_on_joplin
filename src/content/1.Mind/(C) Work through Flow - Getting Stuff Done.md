## Close the dossier
After you've finished this todo. your introduction to Artumis is done. You can consider the following options:
* Tick off the checkboxes for the todo's in the dossiers `Done` lane. This closes the todo's and removes them from the kanban board.
* Archive the dossier
	* Open [Learn Artumis Second Brain -d-](../1.Mind/Learn%20Artumis%20Second%20Brain%20-d-.md)
	* Add the tag `dossier.archive`
	* Remove the tag `dossier.active`

The dossier can now be found under `Archived dossiers` on the [Dossiers](../1.Mind/Dossiers.md) page and it is removed from the kanban board.

As far as Artumis is concerned we've only scratched the service. Open the other notes already here. Try out all the templates. Try to make your own templates and note types. Experiment, have fun and enjoy your second brain!
