# Flow - Getting Stuff Done
###### t
The Artumis writing system is great for enhancing your creativity and amplifying your brain. But it doens't have to stop there. You can apply the same power of notes, tags, templates and queries to getting stuff done or even managing projects. Take a look again at [Create a Todo](../1.Mind/Create%20a%20Todo.md) and [Create a dossier](../1.Mind/Create%20a%20dossier.md). These are the building blocks of Artumis' todo system. 

You can view all dossiers you created at [Dossiers](../1.Mind/Dossiers.md). That page features a kanban board that lets you move dossiers from `backlog` to `active` so you can keep focus. By giving a dossier the tag `dossier.permanent` or `dossier.archive` and removing the tags `dossier.backlog` or `dossier.active` you move a dossier to the permanent or archive list on the same page. 

Each diary day note has a todo section. Todo's are shown here if they have the following properties:
* The todo is not marked as done (not ticked off)
* Tagged as `todo.doing`
* Tagged with the time of that day
	* Year tag, example: `time.2025`
	* Month tag, example `time.march`
	* Day-of-month tag, example: `time.day_05`

Joplin also let's you set a `due date and time` for a todo. This will set off an alarm for that todo on the mobile app on that time and date.
