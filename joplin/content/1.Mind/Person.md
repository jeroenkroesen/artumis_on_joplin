Persons are your adressbook. A person is a note with information on another Human Being. It does not have to be limited to people you know personally.

The template [Person](../Templates/Person%20-TEMPLATE-.md) can be used to make more person notes.

- A person will have a corresponding tag in the format of:
`p.firstname_lastname`
