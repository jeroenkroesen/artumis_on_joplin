# Connect an idea to a topic
###### t



## 1. How notes appear under topics
We use the Joplin plugin `Note Overview` to find notes for a topic and link to them from the topic automatically. Topics will link to a note if that note is *tagged with the topic's tag*. 

All topic tags in the 2nd brain start with a `t.`, followed by a short description of the topic in lowercase letters. For example: if you write extensively about psychology, it makes sense to have a topic that groups notes about psychology. The tag in this case would be straightforward: `t.psychology`. If you want a topic tag consisting of multiple words, use an underscore `_` to separate the words. For example, a topic about Modern art could have as it's tag: `t.modern_art`.

In short: to make a note appear under a topic, tag it with the topic's tag.

## 2. Problem: single diary note contains info on multiple topics
In [Create a diary note](../1.Mind/Create%20a%20diary%20note.md), we created a note to take all your thoughts and writings from a single day.  It makes sense that you might write about more than one topic on a day. So how do we deal this? How do we make sure the information ends up under the right topic?

The easiest solution is simply to tag the diary note with all the topics it contains. This way you can use the topic to browse all the days when you wrote about the topic.  However, this has severe disadvantages. The most important being: only the title of the diary note will appear in the table of notes under the topic. You will be able to see *when* you wrote about the topic, but not *what is was about exactly*.

The way I recommend takes a little bit of effort: to sit down at the end of the day and move ideas from the diary note to their own notes and tag those. This may seem like quite some work at first, but the Artumis method in Joplin has been highly optimized to make it as effortless as possible. And besides, there's *flow advantage* to working like this that I will discuss more deeply in [Flow - Creativity](../1.Mind/Flow%20-%20Creativity.md): you take a moment each day to review your thoughts, perhaps improving and expanding on them and enshrining them more deeply in your memory.

## 3. Moving an idea to it's own note
A fun and easy feature of the Artumis method is that I've added a query to diary notes that automatically embeds notes tagged with that days' year (eg `time.2025`), month (`time.march`) and day of the month (`time.day_06`). So if you take an idea from your diary to a separate note, it will automatically reappear in your diary so you can still view all ideas you had that day. Fun and easy!

To move an idea from the diary to it's own note, first select and copy the text of the idea (`ctrl`+`c`), but without the title. Then press `ctrl` +`shift`+`alt`+`n`. The dialog to make new note from a template appears.

From the dropdown, select the template `01. Note dated` and click `OK` or press the `enter` key.

Next, fill out the fields for the new note:

Be mindfull: there are more fields to scroll down to!
Click `OK` to create the new note. Paste the text from the idea into it. You can now go back to the diary note and delete the idea text there. If you refresh note overview (`F7`), the idea text will reappear automatically.

## 4. Tagging and linking the new note
In the new note, use the hashtag-and-type functionality to add tags to the topics the idea is about. I advise you to also *add links to the topics*, so you can easily navigate there from the note. You can quickly and easily add a link by typing 2 `@` symbols and then start typing the title of the topic. A fuzzy search will begin suggesting notes to you. `Enter` will insert a link to the selected note.
